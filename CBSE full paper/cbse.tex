		\centerline{\textbf{Arthimetic Progression}}

\item solve for $x$ :
	\begin{align}
		\frac{1}{x+1}+\frac{2}{x+2}=\frac{4}{x+4},x \not=-1,-2,-4
	\end{align}

\item the $4^{th}$ term of an A.P. is zero. Prove that the $25^{th}$ term of the $A.P$ is three times its $11^{th}$ term.

\item If the ratio of the sum of first $n$ terms of two 5A.P's is $(7n+1):(4n+27)$, find the ratio of their $m^{th}$ terms.

	\centerline{\textbf{Trigonometry}}

\item A man standing on the deck of a ship,which is $10 m$ above water level, observes the angle of elevation of the top of a hill as $60^{\degree}$ and the angle of depression of the base of hill as $30^{\degree}$. Find the distance of the hill from the ship and the height of the hill.

\item the angle of elevation of the $Q$ of a vertical tower $PQ$ from a point $X$ n the ground is $60^{\degree}$. From $Y,40 m$ vertically above $X$ the angle of elevation of the top $Q$ of tower is $45^{\degree}$. Find the height of the tower $PQ$ and the distance $PX$ (use $\sqrt{3}=1.73$)	
	\centerline{\textbf{Probability}}

\item Three different coins are tossed together. Find the probability of getting
	      \begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*]
 \item exactly two heads,
							
 \item at least two heads
						
 \item at least two tails.
	      \end{enumerate}
\item A number $x$ is selected at random from the numbers $1,2,3$ and $4$.Another number $y$ is selected at random from the numbrs $1,4,9$ and $16$. Find the probability that product of $x$ and $y$ is less than $16$.

\end{enumerate}
